<h3>2-Bonus-Layout-Theme-Switcher-Combo-Ionic-Vue</h3>
This is a BONUS I made for the Layout Switcher video on YouTube that combines the Theme & Layout Switchers into the project app so that both are available to the user in the settings menu.

<h3>WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE</h3>
This template contains 3 different ways to use it. 1. A Settings page 2. A Settings Bottom Sheet 3. A Select Menu in the side menu
What you need to do
this repo contains the src folder from a side menu Ionic Vue Project I have also included a[Readme 2 - What was Changed & Added](/Readme 2 - What was Changed & Added.txt) file explaining the changes to default files and what I've added to make it work. You can drop the files in a new template and start using it, play around to figure out how it works. or you can tear it apart and copy-paste what you need to add to your own project. Watch the video above for a full tutorial on what to use and how it works!
